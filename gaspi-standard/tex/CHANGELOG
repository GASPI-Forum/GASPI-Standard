CHANGELOG of GASPI Standard
created 2016.08.30 by Vanessa End
	
######
Changes from version 16.1 to 16.2
######

In GASPI specification v16.1 and lower, the semantic of
gaspi_write_notify was equivalent to gaspi_write followed by
gaspi_notify. Equivalently, the semantic of
gaspi_write_list_notify was equivalent to gaspi_write_list followed by
gaspi_notify. Due to the change in the semantic in this version,
applications relying on the old semantic of gaspi_write_notify and
gaspi_write_list_notify will have to replace their fencing
gaspi_write_notify and gaspi_write_list_notify call with a gaspi_write,
respectively a gaspi_write_list followed by a gaspi_notify.
